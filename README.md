Spoony Items is a fork from Vanilla Additions built by Chrismin13. The intent behind this plugin is to streamline the features offered in VA and offer those to the players on my server. Some things from VA like slabs recipes have been removed, many of the wooden items are removed, and permissions are more clearly defined for the crafting of items.
